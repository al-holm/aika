[<img src="general/res/logo.jpg" width="150" />](general/res/logo.jpg) 

AIKA is an AI-based app that can be used to replace or support the earlier stages of the integration course for migrants. 

# (A1) Short Description of the System

We are developing an AI-powered integration app aimed at supporting the early stages of the integration process for migrants. Our curriculum is divided into three areas: German, Law, and Politics. By using artificial intelligence, the system generates all learning content and related exercises. Questions about the learning materials could be answered in a dialogue with the system. The system can give legal advices on refugee law and political structure of Germany. The system can understand German, English, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, and Turkish.

# (B1) Development process
- Scrum: We used a Scrum-like Kanban board (to manage backlog and sprints). But we didn't follow the typical roles. We found that our work was more efficient when we didn't have strict roles in managing the development process.
- Sprints: The project is developed in regular iterations called sprints. Each sprint lasts two weeks, during which the functionalities defined in the backlog are implemented. At the end of each sprint, a review session is held to reflect on how the sprint went, whether the sprint goal was achieved, and to adjust the backlog.
- Refactoring: Continuous improvement of the existing code to optimize its structure without changing its external behavior.
- Code Reviews: Every pull request is reviewed by one or more team members before it is approved.
- Incremental Development: The project is developed gradually by implementing use cases in a specific order.
- Use Cases: The project is divided into use cases.

# (C1, E3) Description of the System

## German
Our German learning module focuses on developing users' writing, reading and listening skills through a series of interactive and adaptive lessons. The intelligent tutoring system we have developed not only provides traditional learning content such as grammar explanations, reading and listening texts, but also creates exercises for each lesson. These exercises include single-choice, gap-filling and open-ended questions, all generated by the language model. 
The intelligent system understands German, English, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic and Turkish. Users can also choose to have all system messages translated into their preferred language.

![Introductory message](general/res/1.png)
*Image 1: Introductory message, Image 2: Single-choice question, Image 3: Open-ended question, Image 4: Widget of a listening*

![Introductory message](general/res/2.png)
*Image 1: Grammar explanation, Image 2: Grammar explanation, Image 3: Gap-filling exercise*

In addition, the tutoring system enables a dialogue-based learning approach. Users can ask questions in real time about grammatical details, the meaning of expressions, or for more examples. The system also offers situational phrase help to help users apply and deepen their language skills in different everyday situations.

![Introductory message](general/res/3.png)
*Image 1: Widget of a listening exercise, Image 2: Example of a question on the grammar, Image 3: Example of phrase help*

This interactive and user-centred approach ensures that each learner is supported individually and can progress effectively according to the A2 syllabus.

## Law and Politics

Our law and politics curriculum is designed as an interactive question catalogue. Users can choose from a list of questions covering both legal and political topics. After selecting a question, detailed information on the topic is displayed. There is also the option to enter into a dialogue with our chatbot and explore the topic in more depth.

![Introductory message](general/res/4.png)
*Image 1: Introductory message, Image 2: Legal questions, Image 3: Anti-discrimination questions*


![Question catalogue categories](general/res/ui_examples/law_question_list.png)\
*Image: Question catalogue categories*

The chatbot only answers using information from a knowledge base that we have manually compiled based on official guidelines and guidance. This is to ensure accurate and reliable answers that help learners develop a sound understanding of Germany's legal foundations and political structures.

# (B3) Risk Management

## Possible risks

### Availability of team members

Two of the four team members have jobs in addition to their studies and are not able to work consistently and continuously on the project

###  Lack of protection layers in the LLM used

The responses from the open source LLM we use are not filtered and validated, which can lead to misuse of the application.

## Weighting of the identified risks

### Availability of team members

There is a high probability that the bulk of the work will fall on half the team. This may limit the amount of functionality we can implement during the semester.

### Lack of protection layers in the LLM used

We consider the likelihood of unfair use of LLMs to be imminent. We consider the elimination of this problem to be a priority.

### Legal risks regarding the use of LLMs for legal consulting

The user shouldn't fully rely on the legal tips from the Law-Chatbot, there is a risk of desinformation.

## Strategies for each identified risk

### Availability of team members


Tasks are initially distributed unevenly to avoid unforeseen delays in the completion of tasks by team members who cannot work on the project all the time.  

### Lack of protection layers in the LLM used

Using prompt engineering methods, we build a layer of protection that minimises the risk of unfair and unintended use of LLM functionality.

### Legal risks regarding the use of LLMs for legal consulting

We've added a warning that our model does not provide legal advice, but rather legal tips. The actual details should be discussed with a qualified attorney.

# (C2) Use Cases
## Use Case Diagram
[<img src="general/use_cases.png" width="550" />](general/use_cases.png) 
*Image: Use-Case-Diagram*
## Definitions

**Progress tracker** is a component within the German chat interface that monitors, records, and displays a user's progress through users messages and task completion.

**Learning State** refers to the current status of a user's progress in the curriculum determined by their interactions with the app. It is updated dynamically based on user actions such as sending messages, completing tasks. It consists of already learned topics defined in the curriculum with the sccores for each topic. 

**Curriculum** is organized in a graph structure, where each node represents a specific learning objective or topic, and edges between nodes indicate prerequisite relationships. Each node has other metadata such as type (e.g. Grammar or Vocabulary).

# (E1, E2) Testing

## Goals for Test Coverage
### Code Coverage:
Our goal is to ensure that our tests cover all the possible branches and paths in the code. By focusing on branch coverage, we can identify and address any potential issues in the decision-making logic of the application. This type of coverage ensures that our tests are not just executing lines of code but are also evaluating the various conditions and outcomes that may arise during execution.

### Specification Coverage:
We aim to verify that all the specified requirements and use cases for the application are tested. By creating UI tests to cover the functional requirements, we ensure that the application is tested against its intended use cases. 

## Types of Tests Used
### Unit Tests:
- Focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation.
- Validate that each part of the code works correctly on its own.
### Integration Tests:
- Test the interactions between different components or systems.
- Ensure that the integrated parts of the application work together as expected.
### UI Tests:
- Based on our use cases, verify that the user interface behaves as expected.

# (A3) Experience Report
- Solutions that turned out to be good
  1. Using microservices architecture for the back end
    * Implementing individual small microservices that communicate via HTTP requests proved to be quite simple and efficient. 
    * The microservices are independent, so it was possible to work on one task in parallel without waiting for the related task to be completed elsewhere in the system. 
    * It was possible to test the microservice independently.
  2. Using the Flutter framework for front-end prototyping
    * It was much easier to write code in Dart & build it on Android & IOS devices without writing platform specific code.
    * It was also easier to write Dart code for both the visual components and the custom logic without having 3 different code bases (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  3. Use of the NestJS framework for most microservices
    * It was easier to write server-specific logic (ORM, handling & sending HTTP requests) in NestJS than in Python. 
    * It was easier to write unit tests and mock objects and other microservices endpoints, generate detailed coverage reports and configure tests in NestJs than in Python.
  4. Move the progress tracker implementation out of the current prototype.
    * We found that the progress tracker implementation originally planned for the end of the prototype could distract our attention from the essential details of the application (agent-microservice, front-end) & make the overall software quality much worse.
  5. 3 modular independent parts in the agent microservice
    * Initially, we wanted to create a universal REACT agent for all 3 "AI" parts of the system. However, after evaluating the "universal" agents, we came to the conclusion that we should build 3 simpler modular parts for each user case: answering questions in German chat (React Agent), creating lessons (Lesson Master, hardcoded use of lesson creation tools) and basic RAG setup. All three parts became less complex and could be implemented and tested independently.
- Solutions that turned out to be bad:
  1. We tried to communicate with our third software developer, but still the tasks were very unevenly distributed and in the end we had to refactor the code for the user microservice, which was very time-consuming. That's why we didn't finish 2 tasks we had planned for this prototype:
    * (re)storing message history 
    * persisting user progress & messages in an SQL database. 
    - The code for these tasks was implemented on the client side and partly on the server side. 
    - We also noticed only at the end that the implemented test cases for the user microservice (the task was not assigned to us) had very low code coverage.
  2. Using Python for the agent microservice. 
    * Initially, we planned to use Python libraries for the agent and all LLM communication. However, in practice these libraries turned out to be "too" abstract and full of bugs, so we rewrote all the "AI" parts from scratch, using only AWS calls for communication with the LLM. So the original reason for using Python became obsolete. Our current implementation could also be done in Typescript, then we would use the same programming language and framework for all microservices.

## Possible future work

To improve our learning app, we plan to implement and improve several key components:

+ **Persisting messages**: Persisting messages and responses in a SQL database for consistent data tracking.
+ **Progress Tracker Module**: The introduction of an enhanced progress tracking module will allow us to more accurately track users' learning progress in order to dynamically adapt the learning content.
+ **Improving task generation**: We aim to improve the quality of tasks.
+ **Generating tasks on request**: The development of a function that allows users to generate specific tasks - for example, ‘Create 5 tasks on the topic of perfect with “to be” for me’.
+ **Expansion of the curriculum**: We are planning to expand our German curriculum to include additional topics from levels A2 and B1.
+ **Trial language tests**: The introduction of trial language tests will help users to prepare for official language exams and evaluate their learning progress.
+ **Expansion of legal** and political topics: In addition, we want to expand our range of legal and political content to offer more specific content for different migrant groups.
